#+TITLE: How to setup ox-s5 for export

* Get s5
  - Go to https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ and download version 1.2a2
  - Unzip the download somewhere. On my system I put it in ~C:\S5-v12a2~

* Make sure you have =org-plus-contrib=
  At first I had only the =org= package. It ends up that you need =org-plus-contrib= since it
  has the =ox-s5.el= code. I uninstalled =org= and installed =org-plus-contrib=.

  Once you have the =org-plus-contrib= package installed, you simply need to do is load the module:
  =M-x load<RET>ox-s5<RET>=.

* Configure ox-s5
  You need to configure one thing to point to the =S5=. If you use the path from above (~C:\S5-v12a2~) the
  value for =org-s5-ui-url= points to "file:///C:/S5-v12a2/ui". The =custom-set-variables= entry looks like:
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    '(org-s5-ui-url "file:///C:/S5-v12a2/ui")
  #+END_SRC

* Export
  - Setup up your org file
  - Export the file using =C-x C-e=
  - Enter =s= (select s5 export)
  - Enter =h= (to generate file, you may pick whatever)

* It really is that easy
